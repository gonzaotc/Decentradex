### Decentradex: 
##### A fun pokemon themed NFT collection made from scratch

Every address can mint up to three pokemons for free. <br>
When a pokemon is minted, is pseudo-randomlly generated with one or two elements, one or two weaknesses, a random initial skill and a unique color.<br>
The pokemons can be trained, with a high possibility to evolve. A pokemon can evolve up to evolution 5.<br>
Each time a pokemon evolve from a training, the training possibility of success decreases, getting harder every time.<br>
When a pokemon evolves, gets a new random skill added to his skillset. <br>
The pokemons needs to rest, so the training function has a cooldown (predifined in the smart contract.) <br>
Only the pokemon owner can train it's pokemons. <br>
Have fun!.
